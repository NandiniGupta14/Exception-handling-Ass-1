# Q1.What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.
# Answer-
"""An Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts its normal flow. It is a runtime error that arises
due to unexpected conditions, such as dividing by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or trying to use an undefined variable.

# the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.
"""Exception - 
       1. Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program.
       2. It is Detected while the program is running.
       3. It Can be handled using try and except blocks.
       4. The program can continue running if the exception is handled.
       5. example-Division by zero, file not found, index out of range.
       Syntax - 
       1. Syntax errors occur due to incorrect syntax in the code.
       2. It is Detected before the program is executed, at compile time.
       3. It Cannot be handled,the code must be corrected.
       4. The program wonâ€™t run until syntax errors are fixed.
       5. example- Missing colon, unmatched parentheses, wrong indentation.   """
       
# Q2.What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.
# Answer-
"""If an exception is not handled, the program stops running immediately when the error occurs. This is called a program crash.
it shows an error message (called a traceback) on the screen, telling you what went wrong and where in the code the error happened.

example:
when an exception is not handled:
a = 10/0      , here it is not divisible so it gives an error and not reaches to the next line           
print("The result is :",a)  """

# Q3.Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.
"""the following statements are used to catch and handle exceptions:

1. try: This block contains the code that might raise an exception.
2. except: This block handles the exception, You can specify the type of exception to catch specific errors.
3. else (optional): This block runs if no exceptions occur in the try block.
4. finally (optional): This block always runs, whether or not an exception occurred."""

#Q5.What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.
# Answer-
"""Custom Exceptions- Custom exceptions are user-defined exceptions that allow developers to create specific error types tailored to their
application or use case.These exceptions are derived from the base class Exception and enable more meaningful error handling in programs.
Example -   """
# Defining a custom exception

    def __init__(self , balance , withdraw):
